Iâ€™m a microbiologist passionate about microbial ecology and all kinds of microbe-host interactions. My current research focuses on using 'omics methods to explore microbiota associated with [industrially farmed insects](https://www.fromwastetofeed.com), as well as understanding physicochemical dynamics in insect mass-rearing. My interests span across microbiome research, data science, and visualization, as well as driving sustainable efficiency improvements in various processes.
