Iâ€™m a microbiologist working on microbial communities and microbe-host interactions. My main work revolves around microbiomes related to <a href="https://www.fromwastetofeed.com/">insect farming</a> and investigating dynamics in insect mass-rearing.  

Besides that, I am actively contributing to research activities taking place in the Microbial Resource Management group at the <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/microbiology/index.html.en">Department of Microbiology</a> and the Molecular Ecology group at the <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/ecology">Department of Ecology</a> of the <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at">University of Innsbruck</a>.  

My interests include microbiome research, data science and visualization, and making processes more efficient in a sustainable way.
