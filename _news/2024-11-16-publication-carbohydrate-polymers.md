This study highlights the innovative use of black soldier fly larvae waste to extract bioactive chitosan, a versatile polymer with applications in agriculture. The process integrates enzyme-assisted extraction methods to produce chitosan with antifungal properties and plant-growth-promoting effects. By reducing reliance on crustacean sources, this approach emphasizes sustainability, contributing to a circular bioeconomy while minimizing environmental impacts. The findings underscore the potential of insect-derived chitosan as an effective and eco-friendly alternative for biocontrol and agricultural resilience.
