Discover how the garden fruit chafer (*Pachnoda sinuata* L.) is revolutionizing waste management in the groundbreaking study published in Waste Management. This research highlights the remarkable ability of *P. sinuata* larvae to transform cattle dung into nutrient-rich frass fertilizer, significantly enhancing microbial diversity and reducing antibiotic resistance. Within 28 days, the larvae increased beneficial bacteria in the frass by 2.5 times and decreased antibiotic resistance genes by 2-3 times in just 14 days. This innovative bioconversion process not only offers a sustainable solution to livestock waste recycling but also mitigates the spread of manure-borne pathogens and antibiotic-resistant genes, promoting safer and more efficient resource utilization. Dive into the details of this transformative approach to waste management and its potential to contribute to a circular and green economy.
