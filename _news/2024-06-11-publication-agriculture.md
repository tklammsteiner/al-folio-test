In our latest study, we explored the potential of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the frass of Bombyx mori (silkworm) as probiotics, aiming to enhance sustainable insect farming practices. From 102 isolates, we identified eight potential probiotic strains, with five demonstrating robust probiotic characteristics such as acid and bile salt tolerance, which are crucial for gut survivability. These LAB strains also exhibited significant antagonistic activities against pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our safety assessments confirmed no haemolytic activity and sensitivity to antibiotics like chloramphenicol and amoxicillin. Notably, the identified LAB strains, particularly Enterococcus faecalis strain NBRC 100481, hold promise for improving silkworm health and productivity. Our findings highlight the vital role of LAB in promoting sustainable and efficient insect farming, warranting further in vivo evaluations to confirm their efficacy.
