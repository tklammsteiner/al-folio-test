### **Description**

***
The FWF - Top Citizen Science project "Six-legged livestock: Rearing black soldier fly on biowaste" has the objective to complement the already existing FWF project ["From Waste to Feed: Waste products as a source of protein-rich feedstuff"](https://tklammsteiner.github.io/projects/WASTETOFEED/). The purpose of the currently running FWF project is to evaluate and optimize the production of an animal feedstuff in form of *Hermetia illucens* prepupae fed on a variety of organic waste sources. So far, single and defined diets were tested in laboratory experiments, never mixed diets, such as domestic biowaste. The composition of such source-separate collected biowaste is hard to define, because it strongly depends on the eating habit of the consumers, season and region. To counteract this deficiency, experiments have to be conducted in a high number and with a broad spectrum of different diets and associated biowastes. This perfectly justifies a project based on citizen participation. Citizens who do not usually work in science will, supported by researchers and experts, conduct feeding experiments with black soldier fly larvae at their homes. They will use their daily incurring domestic biowaste using feeding container boxes they are building from scratch. By getting in touch with edible insects, participants will lose their prejudice against insect- based feed which will increase public acceptance of insect based fish- and chicken feed and nutrition. Furthermore, this citizen science project will dismantle existing barriers between science and society, by connecting both in an alliance that forms greater knowledge than science could obtain alone.
