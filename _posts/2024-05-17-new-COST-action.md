## COST Action CA23127 - Group on Insect Nutrition: To Open Nutritional Innovative Challenges (GIN-TONIC)

A new COST Action led by members of the University of Wageningen, ETH ZÃ¼rich, and University of Turin has been granted by COST's Committee of Senior Officials. I'm excited to join as a management committee member in Working Groups 1 and 5, and I look forward to the collaborations, scientific exchanges, and meetings to come.  

Working groups:  
- WG1 - Comparative digestive physiology, microbiota, and feeding behaviour  
- WG2 - Proteins and amino acids  
- WG3 - Lipids, carbohydrates (energy ratios), and fat-soluble compounds such as sterols  
- WG4 - Vitamins and mineral requirements  
- WG5 - Materials and Methods in insect nutrition research
